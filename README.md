This repo contains projects related to marketing analytics and business problems using the R Programming language.

PROJECT 1: MARKETING CAMPAIGN OPTIMIZATION

The goal of the first project is to improve campaign marketing response rate for the bank.  Marketing department needs to understand what is important. How can we allocate resources to those customers who are more likely to respond. This is a classic binary classification problem. We have customers who converted or did not convert. With this project I predict marketing response rates through logistic regression and decision trees. With the output of this data, marketing gets a profile of customers who are similar to those who successfully converted from past marketing campaigns.
