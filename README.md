This repo contains projects related to marketing and business analytics problems using the R Programming language.

PROJECT 1: MARKETING CAMPAIGN OPTIMIZATION

The goal of the first project is to improve campaign marketing response rate for the bank.  Marketing department needs to understand what is important. How can we allocate resources to those customers who are more likely to respond. This is a classic binary classification problem. We have customers who converted or did not convert. With this project I predict marketing response rates through logistic regression and decision trees. With the output of this data, marketing gets a profile of customers who are similar to those who successfully converted from past marketing campaigns.


PROJECT 2: MARKETING CAMPAIGN OPTIMIZATION

The goal of project two is to determine which customers are most likely to respond to a marketing campaign.


PROJECT 3: A/B TEST ANALYSIS

The goal of project three is to analyze the results of an experiment whereby a chain of department stores that ran 3 promotions. The marketing team wants to know which promotion was the most effective in generating sales. The deliverable is to inform the marketing team on the results of the impact of the experiment.

PROJECT 4: PREDICT ONLINE SHOPPING BEHAVIOR

The goal is to identify what characteristics makes a converting customer? What online shopping behaviors exist so we can improve marketing (targeting and customer acquisition) and product (how can we improve our offerings or the customer experience?)

PROJECT 5: PREDICT WHAT FACTORS DRIVE ABSENTEEISM AT WORK

PROJECT 6: CALCULATE CUSTOMER LIFETIME VALUE

PROJECT 7: FACEBOOK PERFORMANCE

The project task is to analyze posts published to the Facebook page of a renowned cosmetics brand. The goal is to identify which posts led to the most customer engagement.

PROJECT 8: CUSTOMER CHURN

My personal favorite and a common business task is to identify what factors lead customers to churn and how can we use this data to improve customer retention. This project identified core insights for business stakeholders. For example:

     1.Fiber optic service is a pain point for customers, but why? Difficult to set up. Quality concerns, Can’t stream Netflix, etc.
     2. Contract type is a no-brainer. If you lock customers into a contract, they can’t churn.
     
The analysis revealed $2 million USD in lost revenue due to churned customers.
