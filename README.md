This repo contains projects related to marketing and business analytics problems using the R Programming language.

PROJECT 1: MARKETING CAMPAIGN OPTIMIZATION - Can we identify the right customers to target?

The goal of the first project is to improve campaign marketing response rate for the bank.  Marketing department needs to understand what is important. How can we allocate resources to those customers who are more likely to respond. This is a classic binary classification problem. We have customers who converted or did not convert. With this project I predict marketing response rates through logistic regression and decision trees. With the output of this data, marketing gets a profile of customers who are similar to those who successfully converted from past marketing campaigns.


PROJECT 2: MARKETING CAMPAIGN OPTIMIZATION - What do customers want?

We have a dataset of subscribers who subscribed to a magazine or not. Can we predict which customers are more likely to subscibe? The goal of project two is to determine which customers are most likely to respond positively to our offer.


PROJECT 3: A/B TEST ANALYSIS - Was our promotion experiment successful?

The goal of project three is to analyze the results of an experiment. A chain of department stores that ran 3 promotions in different markets. The marketing team wants to know which promotion was the most effective in generating sales. The deliverable is to inform the marketing team on the results of the impact of the experiment.


PROJECT 4: PREDICT ONLINE SHOPPING BEHAVIOR

The goal is to identify what characteristics makes a converting customer? What online shopping behaviors exist so we can improve marketing (targeting and customer acquisition) and product (how can we improve our offerings or the customer experience?)


PROJECT 5: FACEBOOK PERFORMANCE - How do we engage with potential customers on Facebook?

The project task is to analyze posts published to the Facebook page of a renowned cosmetics brand. The goal is to identify which posts led to the most customer engagement. Here, I use multiple cluster algorithms to gather insights into post performance. The results of the modeling indicates that posts with photos offered the best ROI in terms of reach. It's an unpaid segment and indicates that posting photos goes a long way in engaging users with our Facebok page. Another important insight is posting on the right day of the week to optimize engagement goals.


PROJECT 6: CUSTOMER CHURN - Why do customers churn and what can we do about it?

My personal favorite and a common business task is to identify what factors lead customers to churn and how can we use this data to improve customer retention. This project identified core insights for business stakeholders. For example:

     1.Most significant factor related to churn is one of our key products, those who have fiber optic service. Fiber optice service is a pain point for customers, but why? Difficult to set up? Quality concerns? Can’t stream Netflix? etc. Data suggests there is a significant problem with the service.
     2.Contract type is 2nd most significant factor leading to churn. This is a no-brainer. If you lock customers into a contract, they can’t churn.
     
The analysis revealed $2 million USD in lost revenue due to churned customers.
