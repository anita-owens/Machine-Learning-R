How can we allocate resources to those customers who are more likely to respond. This is a classic binary classification problem. We have customers who converted or did not convert. With this project I predict marketing response rates through logistic regression and decision trees. With the output of this data, marketing gets a profile of customers who are similar to those who successfully converted from past marketing campaigns.
